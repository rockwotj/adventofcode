For a while I've wanted to learn a language that runs on the BEAM VM. I toyed with erlang in college, but I find it to have obtuse syntax in some ways. I like elixir from what I've read online, but both languages are lacking types - which I really enjoy. Gleam seems to be exactly the sort of language I want to learn here. It's got familiar-ish C like syntax (there are other OCaml/ML languages that have typing and compile to BEAM) and after the first three days is really a pleasure in terms of a functional language I've played with. It's a fairly small language and the standard library seems like it's got the essentials. Anyways. This is after the first three challenges, so we'll see what I like.
